# <h2> Red-Themed Static Landing Page</h2>
 <p> This is the first step in my journey to mastering web development. I've started with a simple, static landing page with a red color theme. The purpose of this project is to build a foundation for developing more complex, user-friendly websites using the MERN stack.
</p>

# <h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This project is part of my hands-on approach to learning the basics of web development.
It includes:
A single-page landing page with a minimalistic red color theme.
Basic HTML, CSS structure to create a visually appealing and responsive design. </p>

# <h2>Goal</h2>
<p> My long-term goal is to develop a series of user-friendly websites and web pages while mastering the core concepts of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This is the first of many projects aimed at gradually building my skills and portfolio as I work towards becoming a skilled web developer.
</p>

# <h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>Learn and implement JavaScript for interactivity.
Dive into React for creating dynamic user interfaces.
Integrate back-end functionality using Node.js and Express.
Explore MongoDB for database management.
